            TradeTactics was founded by a team of IISc alumni who saw the gap between sophisticated trading strategies and the technical expertise needed to implement them effectively. Combining backgrounds in systems engineering, data science, and quantitative trading, we've built solutions for proprietary trading firms, individual traders, and financial institutions across India.

            Our mission is to democratize algorithmic trading by making institutional-grade technology accessible to serious traders at all levels.
